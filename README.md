ML Project PGE3/PGE4

This repository is dedicated to storing all the work for Machine Learning courses taught by Dr. Souhail Hanoune at Aivancity.

The project aims to address 4 distinct use cases:
* Classification and regression
* Image classification
* Object detection
* Unsupervised learning

Topics are proposed independently by each team, and we have respectively chosen:
* Wine datasets sourced from Kaggle and GitHub. We analyzed two different wine databases to explore the potential for blending.
* For image classification, we utilized a sign language image dataset and trained a model on it.
* We also worked with a lung dataset to perform semantic segmentation for better lung visualization.
* Additionally, we utilized tools such as KMeans, PCA, and t-SNE for data visualization, interpretation, and grouping, presenting results on a map.

The data is accessible in the respective branches: classification/regression, sign_classification, detection, unsupervised learning.

The extras branch contains supplementary tasks requested, including:
* Adaboost
* Convolution from scratch

For a comprehensive understanding of the work, please explore the branches provided.
We collected the data ourselves.

This project serves as an excellent opportunity to master and deeply understand Machine Learning.

Thank you, Dr. Souhail Hanoune.
